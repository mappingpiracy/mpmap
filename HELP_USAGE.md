1. General
    - MPMAP is a web-based toolkit for filtering, mapping, analyzing, and exporting a dataset of roughly 6500 maritime piracy incidents. MPMAP is a part of a larger research initiative at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and the University of Amsterdam. Read more about this research initiative at [http://mappingpiracy.net](MappingPiracy.net).
2. Interface and Layout
    - MPMAP consists of three sections:
        - Incident filters (left): used to set criteria for incidents displayed on the map and used in analysis. Also contains functionality for exporting incidents and filters.
        - Map (right top): used to display the geo-coded incidents and their clickable popups, which display detailed incident information.
        - Incident analysis (right bottom): a graph displaying the number of incidents per year based on the countries selected in the Closest Country Filter.
    - By Default, MPMAP displays:
        - Map: the geo-coded incidents recorded in the last three calendar years, including the current calendar year.
        - Incident Analysis: the incidents per year for the top ten countries.
